# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Community Hub is an AI-powered local news and content platform built on Azure Functions with Azure AI Foundry Agents. The system automatically discovers, curates, and delivers hyper-local community content through intelligent web crawling and AI processing.

## Architecture

### Core System Design
- **Azure Functions App**: `commhub-func` (Python 3.12 on Flex Consumption plan)
- **Azure AI Foundry Integration**: Agent-based content processing using REST API endpoints
- **Function-per-Agent Pattern**: Each Azure Function corresponds to a specific AI agent capability

### Key Components
- **Research Agent**: Location-based content discovery using Azure AI Foundry agent `asst_Ij5hGoGiriNuG7VGLGIAZ0zi`
- **Summarization Agent**: Content summarization via chat completions API
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Content sentiment scoring with fallback to keyword-based analysis
- **News Fetcher**: External news API integration with mock data fallback
- **Status Monitor**: Health check and configuration validation

### Azure AI Foundry Integration Pattern
All functions use the standardized Foundry API format:
- **Base URL**: `https://{RESOURCE_NAME}.cognitiveservices.azure.com/`
- **API Version**: `2024-05-01-preview`
- **Authentication**: `api-key` header format (not Bearer tokens)
- **Agent Endpoint**: `/openai/agents/{AGENT_ID}/runs` for agent-specific calls
- **Chat Endpoint**: `/models/chat/completions` for general LLM tasks

## Development Commands

### Local Development
```bash
# Install Azure Functions Core Tools (if not installed)
npm install -g azure-functions-core-tools@4 --unsafe-perm true

# Start local development server
cd function_app
func start

# Test specific endpoint locally
curl -X POST http://localhost:7071/api/research_agent \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"location": "Vancouver"}'
```

### Azure CLI Operations
```bash
# View Function App logs in real-time
az functionapp log tail -n commhub-func -g community-research

# List current application settings
az functionapp config appsettings list --name commhub-func --resource-group community-research

# Update environment variables
az functionapp config appsettings set --name commhub-func --resource-group community-research \
  --settings "RESOURCE_NAME=community-research" "AGENT_ID=asst_Ij5hGoGiriNuG7VGLGIAZ0zi"
```

### GitHub Actions Deployment
- Automatic deployment triggers on push to `main` branch
- Manual deployment available via `workflow_dispatch`
- Package path: `./function_app` (all function code must be in this directory)

## Function Structure

### Required Environment Variables
- `RESOURCE_NAME`: Azure AI Foundry resource name (e.g., "community-research")
- `AGENT_ID`: Azure AI Foundry agent ID (e.g., "asst_Ij5hGoGiriNuG7VGLGIAZ0zi")
- `AZURE_OPENAI_KEY`: API key for Azure AI Foundry authentication

### Function Organization
Each function follows the pattern:
```
function_app/
├── {function_name}/
│   ├── __init__.py          # Main function logic
│   └── function.json        # Azure Functions binding configuration
├── host.json               # Function app configuration
├── requirements.txt        # Python dependencies
└── local.settings.json     # Local development settings
```

### Error Handling Pattern
All functions implement consistent error handling:
- `requests.RequestException` for API call failures (502 status)
- JSON parsing fallback with `{"raw_response": response.text}`
- Environment variable validation with descriptive error messages
- Structured logging before each external API call

### API Response Format
Functions return standardized JSON responses:
- Success: Parsed JSON from Azure AI Foundry or structured data
- Fallback: Mock/keyword-based responses when AI services unavailable
- Error: `{"error": "descriptive message"}` with appropriate HTTP status codes

## Azure AI Foundry Integration Notes

### Authentication Precedence
1. `api-key` header with `AZURE_OPENAI_KEY` (current implementation)
2. Managed Identity authentication (future enhancement)

### Agent vs Chat Completions
- **Research Agent**: Uses `/openai/agents/{AGENT_ID}/runs` for agent-specific intelligence
- **Other Functions**: Use `/models/chat/completions` for general LLM processing

### Logging Requirements
Every Foundry API call must include:
```python
logging.info(f"Calling Foundry endpoint {foundry_url} for function {function_name}")
```

## Content Processing Pipeline

The system implements an adaptive content discovery model:
1. **Content Sources**: Websites and RSS feeds categorized by location
2. **Adaptive Crawling**: Weekly baseline → Daily (if changes) → Hourly (if frequent changes)
3. **AI Processing**: Foundry agents for summarization, categorization, and sentiment analysis
4. **Human Editorial**: Queue-based review system before publication
5. **Geographic Distribution**: Content spreads based on engagement thresholds

## Testing Azure Functions

### Local Testing
```bash
# Test research agent
curl -X POST http://localhost:7071/api/research_agent \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"location": "Vancouver"}'

# Test summarization
curl -X POST http://localhost:7071/api/summarize_events \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '[{"title": "Community Event", "date": "2024-01-01", "description": "Local gathering"}]'

# Test sentiment analysis
curl -X POST http://localhost:7071/api/analyze_sentiment \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "This is a great community initiative!"}'
```

### Production Testing
Replace `localhost:7071` with `https://commhub-func.azurewebsites.net` for deployed function testing.

## Configuration Management

### Local Development
Edit `function_app/local.settings.json` to add required environment variables for local testing.

### Production Configuration
Use Azure CLI or Azure Portal to manage Function App application settings. Never commit secrets to the repository.

## Critical Git Commit Guidelines

### Security Requirements
- **NEVER commit secrets, API keys, or credentials** to the repository
- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
- Use Azure CLI to manage Function App settings, not GitHub secrets
- Always scan code for hardcoded secrets before committing

### Commit Message Format
- **NEVER include "Co-Authored-By: Claude"** in commit messages
- Use descriptive, imperative mood commit messages
- Focus on what the commit accomplishes, not implementation details

### Pre-commit Checklist
```bash
# Before any commit, verify no secrets are present:
grep -r "api[_-]key\|secret\|password\|token" function_app/ --exclude-dir=__pycache__
grep -r "[a-f0-9]{32}" function_app/ --exclude-dir=__pycache__

# Verify environment variables are used correctly
grep -r "os.environ.get\|os.getenv" function_app/
```

## Task Completion Documentation

### Critical Practice: Always Document Progress
**MANDATORY**: At the end of every development session, document what was completed and what's next in this format:

```markdown
